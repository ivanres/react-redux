# React Redux tutorial based in the series by Rem Zolotykh 

Original series located [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuNEz8XtB51K-x3bwCC9uNM_cxXaiCcRY)

The tutorial was eight months old when I started it. Many APIs changed and some parts of the code did not work properly. 

Consider this a working snapshot of that tutorial with fixes for the following setup:

- `react-router 4.1.1`
- `axios 0.16.1`
- `prop-types 15.5.8`
